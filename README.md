# Metagenomic analysis of reef environment microbiome
#
This repository contains all of the code associated with and the analyses performed for: Roitman, S., López-Londoño, T., Shantz, A., Iglesias-Prieto, R., Leventhal, G., Medina, M.  Metagenomic analysis of environmental samples from an anthropogenically impacted reef. (in preparation)
#
The Reef_Environment_Metagenomes_BinningVisualizationAnvio_Procedure.txt file outlines the procedure followed to trim, assemble, bin, and visualize the metagenomes using Anvi'o. 
#
The Reef_Environment_Metagenomes_ContigCoverageHeatmaps.Rmd file outlines the procedure followed in R to generate contig coverage heatmaps using the binning results obtained fromt he procedure above.
#
The Reef_Environment_Metagenomes_FunctionalAnalysisHUMAnN3.txt file contains the procedure followed to find and assign gene family names using HUMAnN3.
#
The Reef_Environment_Metagenomes_MaAsLin2_Procedure.Rmd file outlines the procedure followed to run MaAsLin2 and assess significant associations.
#
Work for this process is still in progress; no procedures are finalized.
